# Harmony Configurations and Example Jobs

This directory will contain files that describe how this service is executed
within Harmony, such as:

- Example job request JSON files
- Service configuration / definition files
- Sample input parameters and payloads

These artifacts will be added once the initial design and component mapping are
complete and we begin prototyping the actual Harmony service.
