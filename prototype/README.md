# Prototype Matchup Container

This directory will host early prototype code for the Harmony-based matchup
container.

Planned contents:

- A simple Python-based matchup implementation
- A `Dockerfile` to run the container under Harmony
- Unit tests for core matching logic
- Small example datasets / configuration files for local testing

This folder is not required for the initial design ticket, but creating it now
provides a clear place to add prototype code in the next phase.
